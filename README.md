**2. To verify your code.** 
	
In the docker container, navigate to `/phpschool` folder.

```bash
  learnyouphp verify <name-of-solution-file>

```
    

**3. Advanced**

This creates a docker container with the `learnyouphp`, `Callablefunctions` workshops and the `workshop-manager`.

```bash

  docker build -t phpschool .
